## Security Policies

### Dependabot

We have enabled Dependabot for dependency scanning. Dependabot will automatically check for updates to our dependencies and create pull requests to keep them up to date.

### CodeQL

We have enabled CodeQL for code scanning. CodeQL will automatically analyze our codebase for potential security vulnerabilities and provide detailed reports.

### Secret Scanning

We have enabled secret scanning to detect and prevent the exposure of sensitive information such as API keys and passwords in our codebase.

### Security Best Practices

- Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions.
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts and services.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.
- Regularly review and audit code for security vulnerabilities.
- Follow secure coding practices and guidelines.
