# Universal Celestial Intelligence Documentation

## Overview
Universal Celestial Intelligence (UCI) is a Julia-based, self-evolving system that integrates universal laws, pattern recognition, self-healing, and cross-domain knowledge. It is designed for adaptability, observability, and continuous improvement.

## Architecture & Core Modules

- **UniversalLawObservatory**: Detects, validates, and applies physical, biological, and mathematical laws. Tracks system metrics and evolution.
- **EvolutionEngine**: Implements self-adaptation, performance optimization, and pattern evolution strategies.
- **SelfHealing**: Monitors health, detects anomalies, and initiates recovery actions for system resilience.
- **ModelRegistry**: Manages models, capabilities, dependencies, and performance thresholds.
- **CentralOrchestrator**: Coordinates all components, manages resources, and optimizes system-wide performance.
- **PlanetaryInterface**: Handles external system connections, protocols, and internet-based enrichment.
- **InternetModule**: Checks connectivity and enriches the codebase with external knowledge via web search.

## Quick Start
```sh
bash start_evolution.sh
```
This script displays codebase metrics, starts the system, monitors evolution, and provides enrichment suggestions.

## Extending & Evolving the System
- Add new laws or patterns in `UniversalLawObservatory/`
- Implement new adaptation strategies in `EvolutionEngine/`
- Register new models or capabilities in `ModelRegistry/`
- Integrate new data sources or protocols in `PlanetaryInterface/`
- Use `InternetModule` to fetch and apply external best practices

## Best Practices & Future Guidelines
- **Observability**: Use metrics and logs to monitor system health and evolution.
- **Loose Coupling**: Design modules with clear interfaces for independent evolution.
- **Self-Healing**: Ensure all components register with the healing system for anomaly detection.
- **External Enrichment**: Regularly use the InternetModule to discover new patterns and practices.
- **Documentation**: Update this file and inline docstrings as the system evolves.
- **Testing**: Add tests for new modules and features in the `test/` directory.
